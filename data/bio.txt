Agon Serifi is a postdoctoral researcher at Disney Research, where he focuses on physics-based character control, deep reinforcement learning, and embodied intelligence. He is also a member of the Computer Graphics Laboratory at ETH Zurich, where he pursued a PhD in Computer Science under the supervision of Prof. Markus Gross and Dr. Moritz Bächer, in collaboration with Disney Research. His doctoral research centered on developing methods for creating lifelike, versatile, and dynamic motions for robotic characters. Agon completed both his Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees at ETH Zurich. Through his research, he is committed to advancing embodied intelligence by learning from human behavior and bridging the gap between simulation and reality, enabling robotic characters to integrate seamlessly into our world.
